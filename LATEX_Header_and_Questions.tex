\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Last summer I took two online classes - Linear Algebra (MATH 310) and Statistics (STAT 301). I also worked as a delivery driver for Jimmy Johns. This coming summer I will be sent to a training evolution for the US Navy aboard a submarine somewhere in the Pacific for about a month . During this training I will be shadowing a Nuclear Propulsion Officer to learn more about the Nuclear Submarine pipeline, and determine if that is the job I still want to choose after graduation. 
        \end{enumerate}
        \item What do you personally want to get out of this lab?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item I would like to become proficient in coding in Python as well as writing technical documents in LATEX. These seem like valuable skills to have for future employment.
        \end{enumerate}
